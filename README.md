# Learning Transformers

A learning environment for transformers to interfere a large language model (LLM).

## Installation

### 1. Install Git and Conda

Download and install the latest versions:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.com)
* [Miniconda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install)

### 2. Clone the repository from GitHub

Clone the repository to a nice place on your machine via:

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/countzero/learning_transformers
```

### 3. Create a new Conda environment

Create a new Conda environment for this project with a specific version of Python:

```Shell
conda create --name learning_transformers python=3.10
```

### 4. Initialize Conda for shell interaction

To make Conda available in you current shell execute the following:

```Shell
conda init
```

**Hint:** You can always revert this via `conda init --reverse`.

### 5. Activate the Conda environment

And activate the new environment via:

```Shell
conda activate learning_transformers
```

### 6. Install all dependencies

Within the working directory of the repository and inside the `learning_transformers` Conda Environment execute the following to install all required Python packages:

```Shell
pip install --requirement ./requirements.txt
```

### 7. Download a large language model

Download a large language model (LLM) with weights in the pytorch format into the `./models` directory. You can for example download the [Falcon-7B](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b) model:

```Shell
git clone https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct ./models/falcon-7b-instruct
git lfs pull
```

**Hint:** See the [ðŸ¤— Open LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard) for best in class open source LLMs.

## Usage

### Execute

```Shell
python ./main.py
```

The expected output should look something like:

```
Write a response that appropriately completes the following request.

Request: Tell me everything you know about falcons.

Response: Falcons are large birds of prey that typically eat smaller animals like birds,
rodents, and reptiles. They are known for their impressive aerial abilities, which they
use to hunt and catch their prey. Falcons breed in remote areas, typically in mountainous
regions. They build their nests on cliffs and other locations that are exposed to wind
and other elements. In addition to hunting for food, falcons are often used by hunters to
train their hunting skills. They can live up to 10 years in the wild, although some may
live longer.
```

### Benchmark

You can measure the execution time on your machine with the following commands:

#### Unix

```Bash
time python ./main.py
```

#### Windows

```PowerShell
Measure-Command { python .\main.py | Out-Host }
```
